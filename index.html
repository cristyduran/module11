        <p>Prepare and practice for your interview to feel confident and competent during the interview.
            Research what types of questions to expect specific to your desired role. During your interview
            you'll face two different kinds of questions: technical and behavioral. Behavioral questions give the interviewer
            some insight into how you work and collaborate. Make sure to be honest and truthful
            during behavioral questions while also taking the opportunity to showcase
            your strengths.
        </p>

            Technical skills and knowledge will also be covered during the interview for web developer
            positions. Your resume should highlight your development skills. For front-end development,
            interviewers will be looking for competency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and possibly
            other languages and libraries. Some tips for preparing for a front-end developer position
            include:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Google search to find common interview questions.</li>
            <li>Grab a friend and practice simulating the interview conditions and give your answers verbally.</li>
            <li>Continue practicing your coding skills.</li>
            <li>Take online programming courses to aid in your practice before the interview.</li>
        </ul>
